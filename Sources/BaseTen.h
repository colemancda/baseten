/**
 * \mainpage Introduction
 *
 * BaseTen is an open source Cocoa database framework for working with PostgreSQL databases. BaseTen 
 * has been designed with familiar, Core Data -like semantics and APIs. 
 *
 * The BaseTen feature highlights include:
 * \li BaseTen Assistant imports Core Data / Xcode data models.
 * \li Discovers the database schema automatically at runtime, including 1-1, 1-many and many-many relationships.
 * \li Database changes are propagated to clients automatically, without polling.
 * \li In-memory database objects are uniqued, and objects fetched via relationships are faults by default.
 * \li Support for RDBMS features like database-driven data validation, multi-column primary keys and updateable views.
 * \li Autocommit and manual save/rollback modes, both with NSUndoManager integration.
 * \li A BaseTen-aware NSArrayController subclass automates locking and change propagation.
 * \li Fetches are specified with NSPredicates (the relevant portions of which are evaluated on the database).

 *
 * BaseTen aims to provide a Core Data -like API for handling a database. A database connection is managed
 * by an instance of BXDatabaseContext, which also fetches rows from the database. Rows are represented
 * by instances of BXDatabaseObject. Objects are identified by 
 * \link BXDatabaseObjectID BXDatabaseObjectIDs\endlink, that are created using
 * tables' primary keys. Foreign keys are interpreted as relationships between objects.
 *
 * Like some other object-relational mappers, BaseTen fetches the data model from the database. 
 * There are classes available for database introspection: BXEntityDescription, BXAttributeDescription, 
 * BXRelationshipDescription and its subclasses.
 *
 * Database objects are retrieved using an instance of BXDatabaseContext. The rows are specified using 
 * instances of BXEntityDescription and NSPredicate. This pattern should match most use cases. It is also
 * possible to fetch rows as NSDictionaries by specifying an SQL query.
 *
 * Unlike the typical use case of Core Data, multiple users might be connected to the database being 
 * accessed using BaseTen. Thus, data manipulated with database objects could change at any time. BaseTen
 * copes with this situation by updating objects' contents as soon as other database clients commit their
 * changes. The other clients needn't use BaseTen.
 *
 * Instead of constantly polling the database for changes, BaseTen listens for PostgreSQL notifications.
 * It then queries the database about the notification type and faults the relevant objects. For this to
 * work, certain tables, views and functions need to be created in the database. The easiest way to do this
 * is to connect to the database with BaseTen Assistant. Using it, relations may be enabled for use with 
 * the framework. Everything will be installed or will reference to a database schema called baseten, so
 * removal, if needed, will be an easy process. BaseTen can connect to databases without the schema, but
 * in this case functionality will be limited.
 *
 * Since BaseTen relies on database introspection, SQL may be used to define the database schema.
 * Another option is to create a data model using Xcode's data modeler and import it using BaseTen Assistant.

/**
 * \page predicates Predicates
 *
 * Most types of predicates and expressions are converted to SQL and sent to the database server.
 * Others cause the returned object set to be filtered again on the client side. Specifically, the following
 * use cases work in this manner: The affected part of the predicate is replaced with \em true (or \em false, 
 * if the part is inside an odd number of NOT predicates), and excess objects are removed from the result set 
 * after it has been received.
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Use of NSDiacriticInsensitivePredicateOption</li>
 *     <li>Use of NSCustomSelectorPredicateOperatorType</li>
 *     <li>Use of NSSubqueryExpressionType</li>
 *     <li>Use of NSUnionSetExpressionType</li>
 *     <li>Use of NSIntersectSetExpressionType</li>
 *     <li>Use of NSMinusSetExpressionType</li>
 *     <li>A modifier other than NSDirectPredicateModifier in combination with any of the following:
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>NSBeginsWithPredicateOperatorType</li>

 *             <li>NSInPredicateOperatorType</li>
 *         </ul>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 */

/**
 * \page sql_views SQL views
 *
 * Contents of SQL views may be manipulated using database objects provided that some conditions are met.
 * Unlike tables, views don't have primary keys but BaseTen still needs to be able to reference individual 
 * rows. If a view has a group of columns that can act as a primary key, the columns may be marked as a 
 * primary key with the assistant, after which the view may be enabled.
 *
 * Views also lack foreign keys. Despite this entities that correspond to views may have relationships
 * provided that a certain condition is met: the view needs to have the column or columns of an underlying
 * table that form a foreign key, and the columns' names need to match. In this case, relationships will 
 * be created between the view and the target table as well as the view and all the views that are based
 * on the target table and contain the columns the foreign key references to. This applies to the complete
 * view hierarchy.
 *
 * PostgreSQL allows INSERT and UPDATE queries to target views if rules have been created to handle them.
 * In this case, the view contents may be modified also with BaseTen.
 */

/**
 * \page baseten_enabling More detail on enabling relations
 *
 * Some tables are created in BaseTen schema to track changes in other relations. The association is based
 * on relation \em oids \ref baseten_enabling_ref_1 "ยน". The BaseTen tables store values for the actual 
 * relations' primary keys. Thus, changing tables' primary keys after having them enabled will not work. 
 * Should this need to be done, first disable the relation, then alter the primary key and finally enable 
 * the relation again. Renaming or otherwise altering relations should be possible, though.
 *
 * In addition to using BaseTen Assistant, it is possible to enable and disable tables with SQL functions.
 * The functions are <em>baseten.enable</em> and <em>baseten.disable</em> and they take an \em oid as an argument.
 *
 * Views' primary keys are stored in <em>baseten.view_pkey</em>. The table has three columns: \em nspname, 
 * \em relname and \em attname, which correspond to the view's schema name, the view's name and each primary 
 * key column's name respectively. They also make up the table's primary key. In addition to using 
 * BaseTen Assistant, it is possible to determine a view's primary key by inserting rows into the table.
 *
 * Relationships and view hierarchies among other things are stored in automatically-generated tables. 
 * These should be refreshed with the SQL function <em>baseten.refresh_caches</em> after all changes to views,
 * primary keys and foreign keys. BaseTen Assistant does this automatically.
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>\anchor baseten_enabling_ref_1 PostgreSQL assigns an \em oid to each relation. This does not imply that tables should be created WITH OIDS.</li>

 * When the connection attempt has finished, the context's delegate will be called and notifications will
 * be posted to the context's notification center (accessed with 
 * \ref BXDatabaseContext::notificationCenter "-notificationCenter").
 *
 * In AppKit applications, the easiest way to connect to the database is to use the IBAction
 * \ref BXDatabaseContext::connect: "-connect:". In addition to attempting the connection asynchronously,
 * it also presents a number of panels to the user, if some required information is missing from the URI. 
 * The panels allow the user to specify their username, password and the database host making URIs
 * like <tt>pgsql:///database_name</tt> allowed. Additionally a \em kBXConnectionSetupAlertDidEndNotification

/**

 *
 * BXDatabaseObjects implement NSKeyValueCoding and object values may thus be accessed with 
 * -valueForKey: and -setValue:forKey:. The key will be the column name. As with 
 * NSManagedObject, methods like -&lt;key&gt; and -set&lt;Key&gt;: are also automatically available.
 *
 * Column values are converted to Foundation objects based on the column type. Currently, there is no way to 
 * affect the type conversion. Instead, custom getters may be written for preprocessing
 * fetched objects. To support this, the column values may also be accessed using 
 * \ref BXDatabaseObject::primitiveValueForKey: "-primitiveValueForKey:". Similarly 
 * -setPrimitiveValue:forKey: may be used to set a column value.
 *
 * Currently handled types are listed in \ref database_types.
 *
 *
 * \section accessing_relationships Accessing relationships
 *
 * BaseTen supports the same types of relationships as Core Data: one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.
 *
 * One-to-many is the simplest type of these three: a foreign key in one table referring another will be 
 * interpreted as such. Both of the tables need to be BaseTen enabled and BaseTen's cache tables need to be
 * up-to-date (see the BaseTen Assistant for details). Calling a database object's 
 * \ref BXDatabaseObject::valueForKey: "-valueForKey:" or 
 * \ref BXDatabaseObject::primitiveValueForKey: "-primitiveValueForKey:" 
 * on the to-one side with the name of the foreign key constraint will 
 * return the object on the other side of the reference. On the to-many side, -valueForKey: retrieves a 
 * collection of objects that reference the table in a foreign key. They key used is the other table's name.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 * <code>CREATE TABLE person (
 *    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 *    firstname VARCHAR (255),
 *    surname VARCHAR (255)
 *);
 *
 *CREATE TABLE email (
 *    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 *    address VARCHAR (255),
 *    person_id INTEGER REFERENCES person (id)
 *);</code>
 *
 * Lets say we have two objects: \em aPerson and \em anEmail which have been fetched from the person and email
 * tables, respectively. <tt>[aPerson valueForKey: @"email"]</tt> will now return a collection of \em email objects. 
 * <tt>[anEmail valueForKey: @"person"]</tt> will return a single \em person object.
 *
 * If we modify the previous example, we get a one-to-one relationship: 
 * <code>ALTER TABLE email ADD UNIQUE (person_id);</code> 
 * Now both <tt>[aPerson valueForKey: @"email"]</tt> 
 * and <tt>[anEmail valueForKey: @"person"]</tt> will return a single object from the corresponding table.
 *
 * Many-to-many relationships are modeled with helper tables. The helper table needs to have columns to contain 
 * both tables' primary keys. It needs to be BaseTen enabled as well.
 *
 * Another example: 
 *<code>CREATE TABLE person (
 *    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 *    firstname VARCHAR (255),
 *    surname VARCHAR (255)
 *);
 *
 *CREATE TABLE title (
 *    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
 *    name VARCHAR (255)
 *);
 *
 *CREATE TABLE person_title_rel (
 *    person_id INTEGER REFERENCES person (id),
 *    title_id INTEGER REFERENCES title (id),
 *    PRIMARY KEY (person_id, title_id)
 *);</code>
 *
 * Lets say \em aPerson has been fetched from the person table and \em aTitle from the title table. 
 * In this case, <tt>[aPerson valueForKey: @"title"]</tt> will return a collection of title objects 
 * and <tt>[aTitle valueForKey: @"person"]</tt> a collection of person objects. Any two foreign keys 
 * in one table will be interpreted as a many-to-many relationship, if they also form the table's 
 * primary key. Objects from the helper table may be retrieved as with one-to-many relationships: 
 * <tt>[aPerson valueForKey: @"person_title_rel"]</tt>.
 * 
 *
 * \section relationship_naming_conflicts Naming conflicts
 *
 * Referencing relationships with target table names works as long as there are only one foreign key in
 * a given table referencing another. As the number increases, relationships obviously cannot be 
 * referenced using the target table name in every case. The following table describes alternative
 * names for relationships in specific cases.
 *
 * <table>
 *     <caption>Relationship names</caption>
 *     <tr>
 *         <th><strong>Relationship type</strong></th>

/**
 * \page postgresql_installation PostgreSQL installation
 *
 * Here's a brief tutorial on PostgreSQL installation.
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Get the latest PostgreSQL source release (8.2 or later) from http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/source.</li>
 *     <li>Uncompress, configure, make, [sudo] make install. On Mac OS X, Bonjour and OpenSSL are available, so <tt>./configure &ndash;-with-bonjour &ndash;-with-openssl && make && sudo make install</tt> probably gives the expected results.</li>
 *     <li>It's usually a good idea to create a separate user and group for PostgreSQL, but Mac OS X already comes with a database-specific user: for mysql. We'll just use that and hope PostgreSQL doesn't mind.</li>
 *     <li>Make \em mysql the owner of the PostgreSQL folder, then sudo to <tt>mysql</tt>:\n
 *         <tt>
 *             sudo chown -R mysql:mysql /usr/local/pgsql\n
 *             sudo -u mysql -s
 *         </tt>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Initialize the PostgreSQL database folder. We'll use en_US.UTF-8 as the default locale:\n<tt>LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 /usr/local/pgsql/bin/initdb -D \\\n /usr/local/pgsql/data</tt></li>
 *     <li>Launch the PostgreSQL server itself:\n
 *         <tt>
 *             /usr/local/pgsql/bin/pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data \\\n
 *             -l /usr/local/pgsql/data/pg.log start
 *         </tt>
 *     <li>Create a superuser account for yourself. This way, you don't have to sudo to mysql to create new databases and users.\n
 *         <tt>/usr/local/pgsql/bin/createuser <your-short-user-name></tt>
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Exit the \em mysql sudo and create a database. If you create a database with your short user name, psql will connect to it by default.\n
 *         <tt>
 *             exit\n
 *             /usr/local/pgsql/bin/createdb <your-short-user-name>
 *         </tt>
 *     </li>

/**
 * \page building_baseten Building BaseTen
 *
 * For a successful build, Xcode 3.1 and Mac OS X 10.5 SDK are required.
 *
 * BaseTen has several subprojects, namely BaseTenAppKit and a plug-in for Interface Builder 3. The default target in 
 * BaseTen.xcodeproj, <em>BaseTen + GC</em>, builds them as well; the plug-in and the AppKit framework will appear in the 
 * subprojects' build folders, which are set to the default folder. The built files will be either in 
 * \em build folders in the subprojects' folders or in the user-specified build folder. The documentation will be
 * in the \em Documentation folder.
 *
 *
 * \section building_for_the_release_dmg Building for the release disk image
 *
 * The files needed to build the release disk image are in the SVN repository as well. Doxygen is needed during 
 * the process. To create the DMG, follow these steps:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>From the checked-out directory, <tt>cd ReleaseDMG</tt>.</li>
 *     <li>The default location for the built files is <em>BaseTen-dmg-build</em> in the current directory. To set a custom path, edit the \em SYMROOT variable in <em>create_release_dmg.sh</em>.</li>
 *     <li>
 *         Do <tt>./create_release_dmg.sh</tt>. The built DMG will appear in the \em ReleaseDMG folder.
 *         <ul>
 *             <li>If you don't have LaTeX installed, do <tt>./create_release_dmg.sh -&ndash;without-latex</tt> instead. The PDF manual won't be included on the DMG, though.</li>

/** 
 * \page limitations Limitations in current version
 * 
 * These are some of the most severe limitations in the current version.
 * \li Most public classes are non-thread-safe, so thread safety must be enforced externally if it's required.
 *     Furthermore, all queries must be performed from the thread in which the context made a database connection. This could change
 *     in the future, so it is best to create and handle a context only in one thread.
 * \li No serialization mechanism has been implemented for BXDatabaseObject.
 * \li Currently, migration models aren't understood by the assistant, so the easiest way to do model
 *	   migration might be using SQL.
